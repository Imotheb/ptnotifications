## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine or server.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

If you already have Profit Trailer running on the same machine you can ignore this.

Make sure you have Java 8 (1.8.0_131 and up) installed on your computer. (Java 9 will not work).  
Windows & Linux require Java 8 JRE - [Download](https://www.java.com/en/download/).  
Mac OSX requires Java 8 JDK - [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.htm).  

### License

To run PT Notifications you need to have a valid Profit Trailer PRO license.

### Installing

Download the latest version from the releases page.

###### Prepare your Profit Trailer instances
- Give every Profit Trailer instance you run a unique ```server.sitename``` in the ```application.properties``` file. This is so it's easier to recognize your bots easier when receiving notifications.
- Make sure to set the ```server.api_token``` variable in the ```application.properties``` file for each instance as well. This value can be any random arrangement of characters. This is needed so the addon can request access to the trade data.


###### Update the PT Notifications settings
```
#Amount of PT instances you have running
profitTrailer_instances = 1

profitTrailer_address_1 = 
profitTrailer_license_key_1 = 
#Make sure it matches the server.api_token variable in application.properties of your PT instance
profitTrailer_instance_api_token_1 = 

#Example
#profitTrailer_address_2 = http://localhost:8082
#profitTrailer_license_key_2 = 1234567abcd8910
